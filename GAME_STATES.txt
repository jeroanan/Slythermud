Why have game states? To help decide in which context we're being given data in.

What are the states? Well so far, they are:
	
	0 == STATE_NOT_IN_USE == socket isn't in use yet
	1 == STATE_UNAME == waiting for username from the user
	2 == STATE_UNAME2 == waiting for confirmation of username from the user.
	3 == STATE_NEWPASS == waiting for a password on a new character
	4 == STATE_NEWPASS2 == waiting for confirmation of password on a new character.
	5 == STATE_GENDER
	6 == STATE_RACE == Reserved for use later in development.
	7 == STATE_HOMELAND == Reserved for use later in development.
	8 == STATE_CLASS == Reserved for use later in development.

Note that every user does not necessarily go into each state every time they log in. For example, state 2 is only encountered when creating a new character.
